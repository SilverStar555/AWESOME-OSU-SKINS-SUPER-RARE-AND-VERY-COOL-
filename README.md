# Silver's osu! skin remakes and modifications
hello cool people

this my skin list, it is so very cool

# [[3D-BLOCKS]](https://ss555.s-ul.eu/3fv98bI6)
This is a fully custom skin made by me about a year and a half ago or so. It was made using Paint 3D and was nearly finished, but I got very bored and never finished the results screen. It was also never hitsounded. Regardless, I think its time I let it out into the wild for people to enjoy.

# [__[M-NS (SilverStar Edit)]__](https://ss555.s-ul.eu/cWDNqySS)
An edit that greatly improves on M-NS, a remake of pishifat's skin. This skin happens to require automatic cursor size to be turned on; its the only skin I've ever seen that holds that requirement.

# [Pastel Sayo](https://ss555.s-ul.eu/GJKY7Fzp)
This is a skin mix loosely inspired by Willy's Sayo edit that he used to use on stream. Its oddly good for DT

# [rrtyui2011](https://www.mediafire.com/file/uel9pm4fkp3tp3s/rrtyui2011.osk/file)
This is a remake of the classic skin from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h_x0eEZ1QE). I admittedly found a lot of the assets from the original skins later down the line, but this skin is still a nice recreation of a classic that was lost.
